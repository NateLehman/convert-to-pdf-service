## Requirements
This service requires LibreOffice 4.3.7.2 to be installed to the contents directory of the workflow. This is done if you run the install script. LibreOffice is about 1GB.

## Installation

### With Xcode
If you have Xcode installed you can go ahead and use `git` to get everything and install.
Just run the installation script provided:
```bash
cd ~/Downloads
git clone https://github.com/NateLehman/convert-to-pdf-service.git
cd convert-to-pdf-service
sh install.sh
```

### Without Xcode
Just download using the project from GitHub: click the green button and select download `.zip` file. Then open `Terminal.app` and paste the following:
```bash
cd ~/Downloads/convert-to-pdf-service-master
sh install.sh
```

## Uninstall
Just run the provided uninstall script:
```bash
sh uninstall.sh
```

## Acknowledgement
I did **not** write the backend to this service. The only way this code is possible is because of [unoconv](https://github.com/dagwieers/unoconv), a project that does exactly what this service needs to do using LibreOffice. If you like what this does please send your appreciation that way.
